## Releasing

Maintainers only. Requires a clean working tree.

```bash
npm run release:patch   # 0.9.0 → 0.9.1
npm run release:minor   # 0.9.0 → 0.10.0
npm run release:major   # 0.9.0 → 1.0.0
```

This bumps the version, updates `CHANGELOG.md`, commits, tags, and pushes. The GitHub Actions workflow then builds and publishes the release automatically.
