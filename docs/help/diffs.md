# Diffs & previews

## Reading a diff

| Toggle | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Unified ↔ split** | Side-by-side when you want to compare, stacked when you want to read |
| **Word-level** | Highlights just the changed tokens inside an edited line — red on the old, green on the new |
| **Ignore whitespace** | Hides reindentation so the real change surfaces |
| **Wrap** (split only) | Folds long lines inside their column instead of scrolling them |
| **Linked** (split, wrap off) | Scrolls both halves together, vertically and sideways — off, each column scrolls on its own |
| <kbd>⌘F</kbd> | Find inside the diff, with next/previous stepping |

Wrap is off by default, so one line stays on one row and the two sides remain
comparable row for row; each half carries its own sideways scrollbar. Turn
it on when you would rather read a long line than chase it — the cost is that a
line folding over three rows on one side no longer sits opposite its
counterpart. Every toggle remembers its state across files and sessions.

With wrap off the two halves scroll **linked** by default — vertically, which
keeps the rows facing each other, and sideways, so column 90 on the left sits
above column 90 on the right. Unlink them when the sides have drifted apart —
an indented block against an unindented one, a rename that shifted every line —
or when you want to compare two distant regions of the same file, and park each
half where its own content is.

Above every diff sits the [semantic summary](semantic-diff.md) — what changed,
symbol by symbol, rather than line by line.

## Image diffs

Changed images get a real comparison: side by side, or a swipe handle to drag
between before and after.

## Preview anything

The **Preview** mode renders the file instead of showing its source: Markdown,
Word (`.docx`), Excel (`.xlsx`), PDF, video, audio, images, and
syntax-highlighted code for everything else.

## Very large files

Previews and the file view load a file fully into memory, so both refuse files
past a size cap (32 MB for previews, 16 MB for text) and tell you how big the
file is instead. **Load anyway** overrides the cap for that one file — nothing
is off limits, big loads are just opt-in. Files and diffs past a few thousand
lines still render completely, but rows scrolled out of view are no longer
laid out and painted, so a giant lockfile diff stops costing a laptop's worth
of memory.

## Files tab

The left sidebar's **Files** tab browses the working tree itself, with status
badges on folders (added / modified / deleted) that aggregate what is inside
them.
